# Terrain System with a totally cool name

SanityEngine has a heightmap-based terrain, because it's easy and it'll serve my needs

The terrain covers a whole planet, in an equirectangular projection. The terrain is thus divided into chunks of 1024x1024 meters

That can be configurable I guess

Each terrain chunk will have its own heightmap, although they're all parts of the same noise function

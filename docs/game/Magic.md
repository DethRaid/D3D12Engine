Thoughts for a magic system that may or may not eventually exist

# Elemental magic

This magic system is based in basic elements

The classical elements of water, air, earth, and fire are fine and all but they've been explored a lot and I think I can do better

## First law of thermodynamics

Doing anything with magic "creates" energy - but not really, because that energy must come from somewhere. Rather than some abstract "life energy" system, I want something more grounded. You'll have to have special devices that hold matter in a form that's readily convertible to the four fundamental forces. I can call this "mana", but the basic idea is that you collect matter that can be converted into energy

## Concentration

Casting spells requires concentration. Casting instantaneous spells requires instantaneous concentration, but casting spells with a longer duration needs more concentration. One of your RPG stats will determine how well you can concentrate, which will in turn determine the maximum duration of your spells

## Fundamental forces of the universe

My magic system is based on manipulating the four fundamental forces of the universe: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear. I've tweaked them a lot to make them more balanced and fun

### Gravity

Gravity is gravity. You can increase or degrease the gravity in a specific area. This allows for manipulating objects in the world - you might place an attractor in front of you in battle to intercept enemy projectiles, place one above the ground to pull up dirt into a wall, place a repulsor under the water to create a water spout, etc. The player will be able to choose the strength and duration of their attractors and repulsors. They'll be area-of-effect abilities, bluntly affecting areas of the game world or multiple objects

### Electromagnetism

This ability is much more targeted than gravity. You'll be able to shoot lighting out of your hands, induce an electric charge in objects, magnetically move around objects, or shine a light around

#### Inducing an electric charge

Inducing an electric charge in objects will be useful for setting up traps. You'll be able to increase or decrease the electrical charge of an object - you can induce a large charge in a suit of armor to kill the wearer, or induce a charge in a pickaxe so it'll arc when you strike at metallic ores, aiding you in mining, or reduce the charge of a piece of machinery to make it stop working

#### Inducing a magnetic charge

This has a lot of overlap with gravity and thus might not be a thing

If it does end up being a thing, it'd be like gravity, but more localized and only affecting metal objects. Could be useful for constructing gauss rifles or moving metal machinery, or maybe the player only induces electric charges and the world reacts with magnetic charges?

#### Light

Light is the combination of electricity and magnetism. At the bare minimum the player will have a flashlight spell that illuminates an area around them. There may or may not be fun things to with casting light beams to induce an electric/magnetic charge, or vice versa

### Weak nuclear

In the real world, the weak nuclear force holds atoms together. It's responsible for things like nuclear fusion, beta decay, and other fun things. In my magic system, weak nuclear can have a few manifestations. If you weaken the nuclear bonds of the atoms in an are, that are would become radioactive. You could also induce beta decay in an area - this would generate heat and weaken the object that's decaying, giving rise to heat-based gameplay, or disintegrating walls, or other fun things. You could also strengthen the nuclear bonds, making an object harder and less likely to break - but it'd decay back to being a little weaker than normal reasonably quickly, and repeated hardenings would eventually cause the object to completely decay

In the real world, breaking nuclear bonds releases enough heat to create bombs that can level entire cities. That's pretty OP and not something I want to allow. How exactly to resolve that, idk

### Strong nuclear

I don't understand strong nuclear enough to design gameplay systems for it

It seems to involve holding together subatomic particles? Maybe I could implement it as transmutation of some sort?

Strong nuclear has a very short range in the real world. Maybe I can make it melee-focused? Maybe it could be a strong melee power that causes small nuclear explosions when you punch someone?

Needs more thought

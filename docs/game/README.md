# Game

Large, finite, procedurally-generate world. Small villages scattered throughout the world. Voxel terrain that the player can manipulate. Basic fluid simulation for flowing water

The player isn't given much direction, similar to Minecraft. They may cut down trees, dig up the terrain, and build their own structures, etc. They can hang out entirely on their own, doing their own thing and trying to be awesome, or find a village to help. 

## Villages

The gameplay revolves around villages. Left to their own devices, villages will upgrade themselves. The villagers will cut down trees, quarry stone, and mine ores. They'll use these to build more advanced structures and tools

## Gameplay diversity

The game should present the player with situations that the player must approach in different ways

The game must take advantage of a wide number of attributes of differentiation

Presenting the player with situations that force them to do different things will make the gameplay feel more diverse. Think about the actions that the player will take to perform the actions in your game. If they're using the same sequence of actions then your game will not feel very diverse, no matter how many different situations there are

There should be multiple ways to complete most objectives, and those ways should involve the player using multiple skills. One way might require mining and woodcutting skills, one might be mining and combat, etc. These paths should cater to each of the player archetypes, and should provide different ways for each archetype to complete an objective.

## Drama

When the guy at https://youtu.be/d8QAVGeEj-U?list=TLPQMTgwNjIwMjD4tHdCtlwTyg&t=3490 starts talking

"Even though the story is always the same, the dramas were fluid and dynamic"

"Make a system that simulates drama and relationships"

- Champions
- Heroes and villains
- Underdogs
- Grudges and Revenge
- Rematches

All you really need is stats? If you can get people analyzing stats, they'll draw drama between them

Example dramatic narrative structures that you can use:

- Conflict
- Escalation
- Personal within Epic
- Movement through social structures

Give people character traits, even if simple

Can use balancing as a story beat - have some event that forces the player to change their gameplay

Reference times the player did something

- "You did this to me"
- "Now on the news - the player did something!"
- "Thanks for helping me!"

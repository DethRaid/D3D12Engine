# Game

Large, finite, procedurally-generate world. Small villages scattered throughout the world. Voxel terrain that the player can manipulate. Basic fluid simulation for flowing water

The player isn't given much direction, similar to Minecraft. They may cut down trees, dig up the terrain, and build their own structures, etc. They can hang out entirely on their own, doing their own thing and trying to be awesome, or find a village to help. 

## Villages

The gameplay revolves around villages. Left to their own devices, villages will upgrade themselves. The villagers will cut down trees, quarry stone, and mine ores. They'll use these to build more advanced structures and tools

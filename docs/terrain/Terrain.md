# Terrain System with a totally cool name

Sanity Engine has a terrain

The terrain is procedurally generated and finite in size. Finite terrains just work well for me :shrug:

Walking from the south pole to the north pole should take a few hours. This will depend in part on the move speed and exact world size

Each pixel in the terrain heightmap represents a 10km x 10km area of the world. For something the approximate size of the Earth, the terrain heightmap would be 4196 x 2048  pixels. This allows us to have a pretty goos resolution for the climate simulation and allows us to have many global textures with world information
